## Result

The experimentation undertaken to leverage blockchain technology for the detection and reporting of fake social media profiles has yielded promising insights. Through the establishment of a decentralized identity verification system, our experiment sought to mitigate the pervasive issue of fraudulent profiles plaguing online platforms. The utilization of blockchain in storing and managing user identity data demonstrated potential in enhancing transparency, immutability, and trustworthiness within the realm of social media. Our comprehensive dataset encompassing real and synthetic profiles facilitated the training and evaluation of a sophisticated verification model, showcasing commendable accuracy in distinguishing between authentic and counterfeit profiles.
